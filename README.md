# Data Communications Repo #

This is all of my projects from my Data Communications class. Most of the code is detailing how clients and servers communicate. 

In PA1 - I implemented the UDP protocol to transfer data between client and server

In PA2 - I implemented a stop-and-wait protocol

In PA3 - I used mininet to emulate different hosts and switches

All of the code was written in either C++ or Python.
